# es6-playground
Project to play with javascript, html and css. 
It includes babel so we can use ES6 syntax on javascript files.


## Setting up your environment

* Clone this repository
* Run `yarn` to install node dependencies
 
## Starting a development server
Run `yarn start` to run the development server (simple http-server).

The application will be available on your browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Changing javascript files
In a separate terminal window, run `yarn babel` when you make changes to the javascript file to compile it.
You don't need to stop your http-server, but you do need to reload your browser.
